# CraftFiles

CraftFiles is a CLI tool designed to initialize and generate configuration files for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It helps developers quickly set up linters, formatters, environment variables, and AI instructions for their projects.

npm install -g craftfiles
```

## Usage

Run the following command to start the interactive setup:

```bash

This command detects if your project is JavaScript/TypeScript based and prompts you to choose which configuration files to generate, such as Biome (linter/formatter), Prettier (formatter), .env (environment variables), and AGENTS.md (instructions for AI tools).

### Commands

- `craftfiles init`: Initialize project with config files interactively.
- `craftfiles clean`: Remove generated config files.

### Options

- `--help`, `-h`: Display help.
- `--version`, `-V`: Show version.
- `--creator`: Display creator info.
